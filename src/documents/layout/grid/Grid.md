# Vertical
    Use `type="vertical"` make it vertical.

---

# Devider With Title
    Divider with inner title, set `orientation="left/right"` to align it.

# API
        
    If the Ant Design grid layout component does not meet your needs, you can use the excellent layout components of the community:
        
        1. react-flexbox-grid

        2. react-blocks

    The breakpoints of responsive grid follow BootStrap 4 media queries rules (not including `occasionally part`).
